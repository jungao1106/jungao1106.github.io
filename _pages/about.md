**Jun Gao (È´ò‰øä)** is a third-year master's student at Soochow University supervised by [Prof. Ziqiang Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=06ITfcEAAAAJ).
Before graduation, I was a research assistant working for [Prof. Wenjie Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Rx5swD4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at the [NLP Group](https://polyunlp.github.io) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
I also joined the [LINS Lab](https://lins-lab.github.io/group/) of Westlake University as a visitor fortunately supervised by [Prof. Tao LIN](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=QE9pa_cAAAAJ).
Please check my [CV](https://jungao1106.github.io/files/Resume_GAO.pdf) for further information.

Outside of research, I excel in cycling üö¥, taekwondo ü•ã, running üèÉ, badminton üè∏, and basketball üèÄ



Research
======
I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Multidomal Fusion. My current research focuses on:
- (1). How to prompt large models efficiently.
- (2). How to help large models understand our beautiful worlds faithfully.
